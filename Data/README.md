# srl_train
> contains 16 VOC documents annotated for event recognition and semantic role labeling

# srl_train_with_entities
> contains 16 VOC documents annotated for event recognition, semantic role labeling, and named entity recognition and classification

# Usage
> When only training for semantic role labeling the srl_train files can be used, however, srl_train_with_entities is also sufficient as the code provided in this repository is build to distinguish between the columns necessary for each task. The code also provides a function to build a list from all the files in the folders. This list can then be used for further modeling.
